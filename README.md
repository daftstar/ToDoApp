Create a todo list in html and javascript. Take the following:

var tasks = [
  {
    name: 'Create TODO list',
    complete: false
  },
  {
    name: 'Implement Exercise',
    complete: false
  }
];


And, using underscore templates, create a web page that renders all tasks on the page, and has an html form that lets you add more. Make sure you add the new task to the tasks array.
